## Features

### Light/Dark Mode

This template has a built-in light/dark mode. It detects the user preferred color scheme and automatically switches to it. You can also manually switch between light and dark mode by clicking on the sun/moon icon in the top right corner of the page.

### CV

There are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in [assets/json/resume.json](assets/json/resume.json). It is a [known standard](https://jsonresume.org/) for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in [\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml). This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.

What this means is, if there is no resume data defined in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of [\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml) as fallback.

### Publications

Your publications' page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography. Simply edit [\_bibliography/papers.bib](_bibliography/papers.bib). You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing [\_pages/publications.md](_pages/publications.md). By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.

You can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the [assets/pdf/](assets/pdf/) directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: `abstract`, `altmetric`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, `pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`.
